# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jun 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Set up the 100 Days of Code repo

**Thoughts:** Prepping up for the upcoming challenge, excited to commit!

### Day 1: Jun 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Revisited array problems. Completed the array-mountain traversal problem
  
**Thoughts**: You feel crippled when doing LeetCode after a while!!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/magovansh9/LeetCode-Solutions/blob/main/ValidMountainArray.cpp

### Day 2: Jun 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Solved Difference of Two Arrays
  
**Thoughts**: Easy to find an intuitive solution, may not be the best one. Reiterate and optimize

### Day 3: Jun 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Revised Linked Lists, wrote structure functions. Solved two LeetCode problems. Worked on InterProcess Communication in C.
  
**Thoughts**: Sometimes intuition is incorrect, learn more about common algorithms to save time such as Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm
