# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jun 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Set up the 100 Days of Code repo

**Thoughts:** Prepping up for the upcoming challenge, excited to commit!

### Day 1: Jun 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Revisited array problems. Completed the array-mountain traversal problem
  
**Thoughts**: You feel crippled when doing LeetCode after a while!!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/magovansh9/LeetCode-Solutions/blob/main/ValidMountainArray.cpp

### Day 2: Jun 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Solved Difference of Two Arrays
  
**Thoughts**: Easy to find an intuitive solution, may not be the best one. Reiterate and optimize

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/magovansh9/LeetCode-Solutions/blob/main/findDifferenceOfTwoArrays.cpp

### Day 3: Jun 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Revised Linked Lists, wrote structure functions. Solved two LeetCode problems. Worked on InterProcess Communication in C.
  
**Thoughts**: Sometimes intuition is incorrect, learn more about common algorithms to save time such as Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm

### Day 4: Jun 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on UART0 implementation for an Interprocess communication lab in C
  
**Thoughts**: Sometimes you don't get it at all

### Day 5: Jul 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Working on KCD signals to CDISP
  
**Thoughts**: Working on Lab

### Day 6: Jul 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Figuring out the pUART hardware interrupts
  
**Thoughts**: Working on Lab

### Day 7: Jul 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Finished simulator testing for the lab
  
**Thoughts**: Working on Lab

### Day 8: Jul 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Finished Lab. Solved two problems for Linked Lists
  
**Thoughts**: Sometimes the easy stuff takes a toll. For a second there, I was second...guessing myself pretty hard

### Day 9: Jul 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Solved two Linked List problems
  
**Thoughts**: Tried a medium, involved recursion was pretty hard. Another medium was easy, gave me my confidence back. Gonna do linked lists this week. Having trouble formulating a plan for solving problems, too much content out there. For now solve problems by data structure -> by patterns -> Grind 75

### Day 11: Jul 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Finished Insert, Delete and Search Array problems for array
  
**Thoughts**: I struggle with visualizing the algorithm, visualize the algorithm and then translate it to code

### Day 12: Jul 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Reviewed a few array and LL problems
  
**Thoughts**: I BROKE MY STREAK :(((( It's okay, I guess the whole point is to get back to it. We'll do a 100 days if not consecutive 100 days.
